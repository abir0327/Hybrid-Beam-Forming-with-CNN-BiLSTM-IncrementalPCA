# Deep Learning based enhanced hybrid beamforming using RSSI signals in MIMO systems
Massive MIMO involves scaling up the number of antennas in the base station to serve multiple users. It has been observed that as the number of antennas in the BS increases, the impacts of rapid signal fading and interference diminish. Nevertheless, the extensive array of antenna elements in massive MIMO presents significant challenges. The substantial quantity of radio frequency (RF) chains, corresponding to each antenna element, increases both costs and energy consumption. Additionally, the process of determining channel state information (CSI) between each transmit and receive antenna demands a considerable allocation of spectral resources. One potential answer to these issues is the utilization of hybrid transceivers. These transceivers integrate analog beamformers of RF domain with digital beamformers of baseband domain, thereby reducing the need for multiple up-down conversion chains to connect the RF and baseband domains. The design of hybrid precoding matrices typically necessitates a precise estimation of the millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel. However, explicitly estimating the mmWave channel poses a challenge due to the substantial number of antennas on both the transmitting and receiving ends. This challenge leads to high training overhead and encounters hardware limitations concerning the RF chains.
